Class Compass - VESIT Timetable Helper
This is a simple, front-end web application designed to help students at VESIT navigate their daily academic schedule. It provides real-time information on current and upcoming lectures, room availability, and teacher locations.

Features
My Schedule: Check your current or next lecture based on your division and lab batch. The logic correctly handles electives, minors, tutorials, and batch-specific labs.

Room Status: Find all available rooms, or check the status of a specific room. The app intelligently handles lectures with multiple room options, marking them as "Potentially Occupied."

Find Teacher: Locate any professor on campus based on the current time and day.

Choice Persistence: Remembers your elective, minor, and tutorial choices so you don't have to select them every time.
