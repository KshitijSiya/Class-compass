# Class Compass - A Smart Timetable PWA

> College is complicated, Your timetable shouldn't be.

Class Compass is a front-end web application designed to help college students navigate their daily academic schedule with ease. It provides real-time, personalized information on lectures, room availability, and teacher locations, all wrapped in a fast, installable, and offline-capable Progressive Web App (PWA).
